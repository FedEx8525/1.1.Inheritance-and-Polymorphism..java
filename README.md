#1.1-Inheritance and Polymorphism-Level 1

📄Exercises Level 1 and 2 of Sprint1
- S1_T1_L1_Ex1: Sprint1 Task1 Level1 Exercice1 :          
    This Java exercise covers the concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, and static members.
    Create a demonstration of the different ways a class is loaded into memory by the JVM 
    (creation of the first instance vs. access to a static member), and research on static and instance initialization blocks in Java.
- S1_T1_L1_Ex2: Sprint1 Task1 Level1 Exercice2 :          
    This Java exercise involves creating a class named "Cotxe" (Car) to illustrate the use and differences between static, final, and static final attributes.
    The goal is to demonstrate which attributes can be initialized within the class's constructor and the difference in behavior and scope for each type of attribute.
    Finally, the exercise requires demonstrating how to call both the static and non-static methods from the main() method of the principal class.
- S1_T1_L2_Ex1: Sprint1 Task1 Level2 Exercice1 :
    This Java exercise focuses on demonstrating the concepts of class inheritance and interface implementation.
    The exercise requires creating an instance of the Smartphone class in the main() method and invoking all the defined methods (call, photograph, and alarm)
    to demonstrate functionality.
